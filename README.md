# py-myopl-code

All code for my "Make your own programming language in Python" tutorial series on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD

This code is an interpreter for a BASIC-like language written in Python 3.

The latest code is in the folder which is for the latest episode (`ep14`).

I'm now finished with the development of this project, and the tutorials are complete on YouTube.

## Forks

Improvements have been made by others so I'll link to them here:

 - [AdrianGjerstad](https://github.com/AdrianGjerstad/py-myopl-code) - started on standard library and added string indexing

 - [jirachi](https://github.com/IfanTsai/jirachi) - Implemented by Golang
